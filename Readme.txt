Simple and elegant plugin to display GDPR modal that manages your site cookies.

== Description ==

This plugin will show a modal with three distinct cookie levels used for the site functionality - general cookies (privacy cookies); required cookies (things like Google maps and fonts); functional cookies (additional site functionality and security like translation settings); advertising cookies (cookies used for analytics purposes, either from companies like Google, Facebook or Adobe).

You can also set the cookie keys that you want to use inside certain level, and list all cookie domains that are not automatically deleted when setting basic level of cookies. If the user clicks on the I don't agree, no cookies will be saved.

In addition to that you have a simple statistics of which cookie setting is selected in the admin dashboard.
